Over the last 8 years, I've really enjoyed partnering with UX, Security, Internal IT, Product, Engineering & Data teams as a Talent professional. By sharing these resources with the world, I hope to empower other folks in HR to be true talent partners to the R&D groups they support and ultimately help build life changing products. **If you're looking to stay connected, feel free to reach out to [me](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cannychiu/).** This Github repo will continue to evolve as my own professional interests evolve.
